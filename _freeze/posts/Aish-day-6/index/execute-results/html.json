However, there is something called as a **confidence interval**, whisk is the standard deviation around the sample mean. With confidence interval, we can say that the probability of population mean being within this range is rather very high.\n\n-   narrow confidence intervals correlate to high accuracy of the sample set.\n\n# Basics of Randomization Tests\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mosaic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'mosaic':\n  method                           from   \n  fortify.SpatialPolygonsDataFrame ggplot2\n\nThe 'mosaic' package masks several functions from core packages in order to add \nadditional features.

We *state* either that:\n\na.  there is really nothing happening with our research question, and that anything we see in the data is the outcome of random chance.\n\nb.  the value/statistic indicated by the data is off the mark and ought to be something else.\n\nWe then calculate how slim the chances are of the given data sample showing up like that, **given our belief**. It is a distance measurement of sorts. If those chances are too low, then that might alter our belief. This is the attitude that lies at the heart of *Hypothesis Testing*.\n\n### **Case Study #1: Toy data**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(40)  # for replication\n# Data as individual vectors ( for t.tests etc)\ny <- rnorm(50, mean = 2, sd = 2)\n\n# And as tibble too\nmydata <- tibble(y = y)\nmydata\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 50 × 1\n        y\n    <dbl>\n 1  2.96 \n 2  2.99 \n 3  0.281\n 4  0.342\n 5  1.36 \n 6 -0.608\n 7 -0.843\n 8  5.49 \n 9  1.42 \n10 -0.618\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### **Inspecting and Charting Data**\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmydata %>%\n    gf_density(~y) %>%\n    gf_fitdistr(dist = \"dnorm\") %>%\n    gf_labs(title = \"Densities of Original Data Variables\", subtitle = \"Compared with Normal Density\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   The variable y appear to be centred around 2\n\n-   It does not seem to be normally distributed…\n\n**Research Question** - Could the mean of the population μ, from which y has been drawn, be zero?\n\n**Assumption** - variable does not appear to be normally distributed.
