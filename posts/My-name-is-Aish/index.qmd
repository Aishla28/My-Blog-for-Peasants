## Introduction

Hey there, I am Aish

## My first piece of R code

```{r}
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
library(ggformula)
```

```{r}
babynames::babynames
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Aishwarya" | name == "Aishwaria")
```

```{r}
babynames %>% filter(name == "Shashank" | name == "Harsha") %>% 
  gf_line(n ~ year)
```

My name is damn cool!
